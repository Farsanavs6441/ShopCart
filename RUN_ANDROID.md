# Android Build Issue - React Native Reanimated Incompatibility

## Problem
React Native 0.82 is incompatible with current versions of react-native-reanimated.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Downgrade React Native (Recommended)
```bash
npm install react-native@0.76.0 --save
npm install react-native-reanimated@3.6.0 --save
cd android && ./gradlew clean
cd .. && npx react-native run-android
```

### Option 2: Remove Reanimated Animations
Remove react-native-reanimated from package.json and remove animated components from code.

### Option 3: Wait for Reanimated Update
Wait for react-native-reanimated to support React Native 0.82.

## Current Status
- React Native: 0.82.0
- Reanimated: 3.6.0 (incompatible)
- Error: Compilation errors in Reanimated Android code

## Temporary Workaround
The app works on iOS. For Android, downgrade React Native to 0.76.x or remove reanimated dependency.
